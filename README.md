## PURPOSE
The purpose of the charity funding analysis for Alphabet Soup was to predict where the company would approve/make investments. Our goal was to use machine learning and neural networks to apply target/features on the dataset, create a binary classifier that was capable of predicting whether investors would be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

Target variable:
IS_SUCCESSFUL

Dropped Variables:
EIN and Name

The model achieved performance of 72.62%

layers(2) :(80,30) , output layer :1

       
                                                                 



## Optimization:
1.Added third layer 
2.Addded neurons
3.Adjusted epochs and learning rate

The model achieved performance of 72.90%

layers(3) :(50,25,13) , output layer :1
